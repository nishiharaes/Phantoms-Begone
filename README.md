A Minecraft Fabric mod that adds a way to get rid of Phantoms from your world.

Mining "Night Crystal Ore" will allow you to get "Raw Night Crystal" which you can smelt to get "Night Crystals"
These can then be combined with "Processed Phantom Membranes" to craft the "Phantom Repellent"

When this item is in the player's inventory, the player will obtain night vision and any phantoms in a 50 block radius will die.
